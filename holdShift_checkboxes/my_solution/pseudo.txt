-> gather input items into array;
-> hang an event listtener on document, for a shift btn keydown event
-> check if any item is checked on the list:
    => if checked, then we hang an event listener on each item within the array
    => we define the closest item with the attribute "checked" to the one, 
        that was clicked on
    => we map the array using the range and set all the items attr "checked" there
